# Road Accident Analysis and Hotspot Detection

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes UK road accident data to identify patterns and contributing factors based on road conditions, weather, and time of day. It also visualizes accident hotspots using an interactive map.

## 📊 Dataset
- Provided as `Road Accident Data.csv`
- Key features: `Time`, `Weather_Conditions`, `Road_Surface_Conditions`, `Latitude`, `Longitude`, `Accident_Severity`

## 🧠 Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Folium (for geospatial visualization)

## ⚙️ Steps
1. Clean and process the dataset
2. Analyze accident frequency by:
   - Hour of the day
   - Weather conditions
   - Road surface conditions
3. Visualize accident hotspots using `Folium` heatmaps

## 🌍 Interactive Output
- `accident_hotspots.html` — viewable in any browser

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Severity-based heatmaps
- Time-filtered geospatial visualization
- Dashboards using Plotly or Streamlit
